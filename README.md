# CarPartsApp

This App is made for the used Cars Parts Shops, which provide the ability to calculate inventory and count items available with inventory budjet analysis.

This app can be used bu three types of users:
- Original user (Purchaser)
- Shop owner (Manage the Inventory and view analysis as also buy/sell)
- Shop/Store worker/employee (sell products by default and permissions can be changed by shop owner as adding buy permission to him or view some of analysis without financial details)

  As the app helps in finding and part by filtering by car and part type also it helps in managing Inventory for the store owner and finance transactions and balances so it is as mini ERP system just to surve the parts shop.
  App also contains a chat section were shop owners and customers can contact each others as it can be between shop owners togather and with thier workers/employees.
